## About
Gateways to Eternity is a Minecraft mod where you open giant portals which pour forth hordes of enemies in a series of waves, each wave stronger than the last.  Completion of a wave will yield rewards, and completing the entire gateway will yield a completion bonus.

See the [CurseForge Page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/gateways-to-eterrnity) for the full description.

## Pack Developers
