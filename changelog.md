## 5.0.1
* Updated to NeoForge 21.1.61 and Apothic Attributes 2.4.0.

## 5.0.0
* Updated to Minecraft 1.21.1.
* Added a workaround for Jade not displaying properly when Gateway boss bars were shown.

## 4.2.6
* Quarkrus: Added russian translation.

## 4.2.5
* Made gate pearls report the creator modid instead of always reporting `gateways`.

## 4.2.4
* Fixed the way that spawn algorithms operate when in a void world.

## 4.2.3
* Fixed the `/open_gateway` command not being registered.

## 4.2.2
* Fixed a bug where attack targets could be set to a fake player, causing mobs to lock onto nothing.
* Fixed the Gateway of Overworldian Nights not allowing discards.
  * This flag should typically be raised for any gate that spawns a mob that can delete itself.

## 4.2.1
* Added the ability for Endless Modifiers to adjust the wave time and setup time.

## 4.2.0
* This update brings a substantial refactor to the Gateway json format - you will need to update your files accordingly!
  * Many new controls have been added, and some old controls have been adjusted. The default values of things have also changed.
  * The new schema files are located [here](./schema/).
* Gateways now depends on Apothic Attributes.
* Removed all of the original single-mob Gateways.
* Added the following Gateways:
  * Gate of the Emerald Grove.
  * Gate of Overworldian Nights.
  * Gate of the Hellish Fortress.
  * Single-mob Gateways for Blazes, Endermen, and Slimes.
  * Endless Blaze Gateway.
  * More to come in future updates.
* Jared: Added native CraftTweaker support, including bindings for the gateway entity and all of the gateway events.
* Added an event handler to prevent Wave entities from despawning while the gate is alive.
  * Wave Entities always have `Mob#setPersistenceRequired` called, but mobs could bypass this via event.
* Removed the 25 block exclusion radius for Gateways.
  * This was replaced with a check that a Gateway's bounding box may not overlap with another Gateway.
  * Additionally, a Gateway may now declare a `spacing` value to prevent it from being placed near other Gateways.
* Updated the default value for `allow_discarding` from `false` to `true`.
* Wave entities may now be declared with a `count` so that multiple copies do not have to be made for the same entity.
* Removed `completion_xp` and added the `experience` reward type.
* Wave entities may now specify a `desc` key to change what is shown in the tooltip.
* Top-level `rewards` will now be displayed as `Key Rewards` and are always shown on the pearl.
  * Most rewards should be in the wave, but noteworthy completion rewards should be placed in this section.
* Rewards and Failures now enforce usage of the namespace in their type keys. The namespace for all the defaults is `gateways`.
* Redid Gate Pearl tooltips.
* Gate Pearls can now stack to 64.
* Oh, and as a side effect, it is now possible for addons to be created which register custom gateway types.
* The CurseForge Page has been updated to reflect these changes.

## 4.1.1
* Removed forge dependency line from the mods.toml and marked as Forge and NeoForge for CF.
  * The dependency will be added back and the Forge marker will be removed once CF supports Neo correctly.
* Reduced default leash range from 32 to 24.

## 4.1.0
* Updated to Placebo 8.3.0 and refactored code to use DynamicHolder instead of keeping live Gateway references.

* Fixed GateEvent.WaveEnd and GateEvent.WaveEntitySpawned not firing.
  * Somehow these were lost between 1.18 and 1.19.

## 3.2.0
* Updated to Placebo 7.2.0
* Added some more color to the tooltips.
* The "Hold Alt to show Failures" text will no longer show if the Gateway has no failure penalties.
* Gateways will now properly fail (instead of stalling) when a mob is removed but not killed.
* Gateways now have three new fields: "spawn_algorithm", "player_damage_only", and "allow_discarding".
  * "spawn_algorithm" allows for selecting how Wave Entity spawn positions are selected.
  * "player_damage_only" can be used to enforce that the Wave Entities are only hurt by player damage (excluding fake players).
  * "allow_discarding" can be used to enable discards (entity removals that are not kills) to count as kills. This is enabled by default for the creeper gates.
  * See the schema for more information.
* The "allow_discarding" and "player_damage_only" properties will be reflected in the gate tooltip. The "spawn_algorithm" property will not.
* The JSON Schema has been updated to reflect 3.2.0, and is available [here](https://gist.github.com/Shadows-of-Fire/a45a2742b7a0842c50738d3df3ce8148).
