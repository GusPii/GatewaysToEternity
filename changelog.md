## 3.2.3
* Fixed a compat issue with Placebo 7.4.0

## 3.2.2
* Added the `remove_mobs_on_failure` flag to allow keeping the mobs around if the gate is failed.

## 3.2.1
* Fixed GateEvent.WaveEnd and GateEvent.WaveEntitySpawned not firing.
  * Somehow these were lost between 1.18 and 1.19.

## 3.2.0
* Updated to Placebo 7.2.0
* Added some more color to the tooltips.
* The "Hold Alt to show Failures" text will no longer show if the Gateway has no failure penalties.
* Gateways will now properly fail (instead of stalling) when a mob is removed but not killed.
* Gateways now have three new fields: "spawn_algorithm", "player_damage_only", and "allow_discarding".
  * "spawn_algorithm" allows for selecting how Wave Entity spawn positions are selected.
  * "player_damage_only" can be used to enforce that the Wave Entities are only hurt by player damage (excluding fake players).
  * "allow_discarding" can be used to enable discards (entity removals that are not kills) to count as kills. This is enabled by default for the creeper gates.
  * See the schema for more information.
* The "allow_discarding" and "player_damage_only" properties will be reflected in the gate tooltip. The "spawn_algorithm" property will not.
* The JSON Schema has been updated to reflect 3.2.0, and is available [here](https://gist.github.com/Shadows-of-Fire/a45a2742b7a0842c50738d3df3ce8148).

* Fixed an issue where gateways would fail to spawn wave entities or would spawn them too far away.
