# Description
A Reward is something provided by a Gateway when an objective is completed.  

# Dependencies
This object references the following objects:
1. [CompoundTag](../../../../Placebo/blob/-/schema/CompoundTag.md)
2. [ItemStack](../../../../Placebo/blob/-/schema/ItemStack.md)
3. [WaveEntity](./WaveEntity.md)

# Subtypes
Reward objects are subtyped, meaning each subtype declares a `"type"` key and its own parameters.

## Stack Reward
Rewards a single ItemStack.

### Schema
```js
{
    "type": "stack",
    "stack": ItemStack      // [Mandatory] || The ItemStack this reward will provide.
}
```

## Stack List Reward
Rewards one or more ItemStacks.

### Schema
```js
{
    "type": "stack_list",
    "stacks": [             // [Mandatory] || List of all stacks this reward will provide.
        ItemStack
    ]
}
```

## Entity Loot Reward
Rewards the loot of a specific entity, as if the summoner had killed it.

### Schema
```js
{
    "type": "entity_loot",
    "entity": "string",     // [Mandatory] || Registry name of the entity to use.
    "nbt": CompoundTag,     // [Optional]  || NBT data that will be loaded onto the entity before evaluating the loot table.
    "rolls": integer        // [Optional]  || The number of times the loot table will be rolled. Default value = 1.
}
```

## Loot Table Reward
Rewards the loot generated by a specific loot table. The loot table will only receive a position, player, and tool context.  
Do not use this for entity loot tables, only use it for chests/block drops or similar.  Use the Entity Loot Reward for entity drops.

### Schema
```js
{
    "type": "loot_table",
    "loot_table": "string", // [Mandatory] || Registry name of the target loot table.
    "rolls": integer,       // [Optional]  || The number of times the loot table will be rolled. Default value = 1.
    "desc": "string"        // [Mandatory] || Lang key (or english text) which will be used to display the reward in the tooltip.
}
```

## Command Reward
Executes a command when rewards would be generated. The keyphrase `<summoner>` will be replaced with the summoning player's name before command execution.  
If the summoner is absent, the closest player will be used instead.

The command will be executed as the gateway entity with a permission level of 2. If you need to execute it as the player, use `execute as <summoner> run ...`.

### Schema
```js
{
    "type": "command",
    "command": "string",    // [Mandatory] || The command string, without a leading slash.
    "desc": "string"        // [Mandatory] || Lang Key (or english text) which will be used to display the reward in the tooltip.
}
```

## Experience Reward
Rewards a certain amount of experience.

### Schema
```js
{
    "type": "experience",
    "experience": integer,  // [Mandatory] || The amount of experience that will be granted.
    "orb_size": integer     // [Optional]  || The size of the experience orbs that will be generated. A larger value will cause fewer individual orbs to generate. Default value = 5.
}
```

## Summon Reward
Summons a wave entity when rewards would be generated.

### Schema
```js
{
    "type": "summon",
    "entity": WaveEntity    // [Mandatory] || The wave entity being spawned.
}
```

## Chanced Reward
Provides a chance to receive any other reward.

### Schema
```js
{
    "type": "chanced",
    "chance": float,        // [Mandatory] || The chance the reward is granted, in the range [0, 1].  0.5 is 50%
    "reward": Reward        // [Mandatory] || The underlying reward.
}
```
